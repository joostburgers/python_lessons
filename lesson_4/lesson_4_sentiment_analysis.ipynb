    "### Differences Between NLTK and RoBERTa:\n",
    "1. **NLTK (VADER)**:\n",
    "    - Uses a lexicon-based approach.\n",
    "    - Performs well on short social media-style texts, but may not capture the full context in longer, more complex sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RoBERTa**:\n",
    "    - Uses a transformer-based deep learning model, which can better understand context.\n",
    "    - However, RoBERTa can sometimes be biased towards its training data (in this case, Twitter-based sentiments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Might These Differences Occur?\n",
    "- **Context Understanding**: RoBERTa uses a much more advanced neural network model, allowing it to grasp nuances better than NLTK.\n",
    "- **Lexicon Limitations**: NLTK relies on predefined dictionaries of words, which means it may miss certain contextual clues or interpret complex sentences inaccurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "- **RoBERTa**: While more accurate in many cases, it might be overfitted to specific domains (e.g., Twitter), which could skew its results on historical or formal texts.\n",
    "- **NLTK**: Fast and simple, but its lexicon-based approach might not always provide a detailed or accurate sentiment analysis in nuanced contexts.\n"

    "By comparing NLTK’s VADER and Hugging Face's RoBERTa, we can see that different sentiment analysis tools offer different strengths. NLTK’s rule-based system is fast and straightforward but can miss complex sentiment cues. RoBERTa, being a transformer model, performs better on context-heavy sentences but can sometimes be biased by its training data. \n"
