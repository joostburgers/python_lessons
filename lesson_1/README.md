### Lesson 1 - Understanding Variables (Python)

**Note: The following content was generated with the assistance of AI.**

This lesson introduces the concept of **variables** in Python, explaining their basic types and how to perform computations with them. It covers essential concepts such as storing values in variables, converting between variable types, and common variable-related errors.

### Key Topics:
1. **Computation and Variables**:
   - Python allows storing values in variables and performing operations on them, which enhances computational flexibility.
   
2. **Variable Types**:
   - **Integer**: Whole numbers (e.g., `1`).
   - **Float**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `3.14159`).
   - **String**: Text data (e.g., `"Hello"`).
   - **Bool**: Boolean values (`True`/`False`).
   
   Python dynamically assigns variable types based on input, unlike many other languages.

3. **TypeErrors**:
   - Python raises errors when trying to compute incompatible types (e.g., adding an integer and a string). Conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`) resolve these issues.

4. **Lists**:
   - Python's **lists** (ordered collections of data) allow for dynamic access and manipulation of elements. Lists can be traversed, sliced, and nested within other lists.
   
5. **Loops**:
   - For loops are used to iterate through lists or ranges of values. Ranges in Python start from 0 and can include custom steps for specific operations.

6. **Functions**:
   - Functions store reusable procedures. They take inputs (parameters), perform operations, and return results. Python functions help streamline tasks like cleaning up data, as demonstrated in a function that capitalizes, removes special characters, and sorts names alphabetically.

This lesson is foundational for understanding Python programming, particularly in handling variables, data types, and basic data structures like lists.
