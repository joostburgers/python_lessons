# Lesson 5: Geoparsing and Sentiment Mapping

## üéØ Overview

This lesson teaches students how to extract geographic locations from text and visualize sentiment patterns on interactive maps. It combines advanced natural language processing, geospatial analysis, and data visualization.

## üìã Lesson Structure (Streamlined)

### 1. **lesson_5_0_installation_setup.ipynb** ‚ö°
**Purpose**: One-stop installation and verification
- Installs all required packages automatically
- Downloads necessary AI models
- Verifies everything works correctly
- **Run this first!**

### 2. **lesson_5_geoparsing_mapping.ipynb** üìö
**Purpose**: Main lesson content
- **Part 1**: Initialize geoparser system
- **Part 2**: Load and process historical text data  
- **Part 3**: Work with complete geoparsed dataset
- **Part 4**: Create interactive sentiment maps

## üîß Installation Requirements

### System Requirements:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **2GB+ free disk space** (for AI models)
- **Internet connection** (for model downloads)
- **8GB+ RAM recommended**

### Key Dependencies:
- `geoparser`: Advanced geographic entity recognition
- `spacy + en_core_web_trf`: Language processing model
- `plotly`: Interactive visualization
- `mapclassify`: Data bucketing for maps
- `pandas, tqdm`: Data manipulation

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Installation** (5-10 minutes):
   ```
   Open: lesson_5_0_installation_setup.ipynb
   Run all cells in order
   Wait for completion
   ```

2. **Main Lesson** (1-2 hours):
   ```
   Open: lesson_5_geoparsing_mapping.ipynb
   Follow the guided steps
   Experiment with the interactive maps
   ```

## üìÅ Required Data Files

The lesson uses these data files from previous lessons:
- `df_virginia_toponym_sentiment_full.pickle` (sentiment analysis results)
- `df_virginia_geoparsed_complete.pickle` (pre-processed geoparsing results)
- `df_geolocations_sentiments.pickle` (aggregated location sentiment data)
- `df_geolocations_sentiments_small.pickle` (filtered dataset for mapping)

**Note**: Some files will be generated during the lesson if missing.

## üéì Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to:

### Technical Skills:
- Use advanced AI models for text processing
- Extract and resolve geographic references in text
- Combine multiple data sources (text + location + sentiment)
- Create interactive maps with custom styling
- Handle real-world data challenges (false positives, scale differences)

### Conceptual Understanding:
- How modern geoparsing works (transformer models + gazetteers)
- Geographic information systems (coordinates, administrative boundaries)
- Data visualization best practices for geospatial data
- The intersection of digital humanities and data science

## üîç What's New/Improved

### Previous Issues Fixed:
1. **Complex Installation**: Now one-click setup with verification
2. **Scattered Instructions**: Clear step-by-step progression
3. **Error-Prone Process**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
4. **Long Processing Times**: Pre-computed datasets + efficient functions
5. **Unclear Objectives**: Explicit learning goals for each section

### Enhancements Added:
- **Automated Dependency Management**: No manual pip installs
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during long operations
- **Error Recovery**: Helpful error messages with solutions
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging visualizations and examples
- **Professional Output**: Publication-quality maps and analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Installation Fails**
- Check internet connection
- Verify sufficient disk space (2GB+)
- Try restarting kernel and re-running installation

**2. Geoparser Initialization Errors**
- Ensure installation notebook completed successfully
- Check that spaCy model downloaded correctly
- Restart kernel and try again

**3. Data Files Missing**
- Some files generated during lesson if missing
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure you're in the lesson_5 directory

**4. Memory Issues**
- Close other applications
- Restart kernel to free memory
- Use the provided sample datasets instead of full datasets

### Getting Help:
1. Check error messages carefully - they include solutions
2. Review the installation verification section
3. Try restarting the kernel and re-running from the beginning
4. Ensure all prerequisites from previous lessons are met

## üéâ Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:
- ‚úÖ Installation notebook completes without errors
- ‚úÖ Geoparser successfully identifies locations in test sentences
- ‚úÖ Interactive maps display correctly in your browser
- ‚úÖ You can modify map parameters and see results change

## üìö Extension Activities

For advanced students:
1. **Custom Data**: Apply the workflow to your own text corpus
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Add time dimensions to sentiment mapping
3. **Comparative Studies**: Compare sentiment across different authors/periods
4. **Integration**: Combine with demographic or economic data
5. **Publication**: Export maps for use in presentations or papers
